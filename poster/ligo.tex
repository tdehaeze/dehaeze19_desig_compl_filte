The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by designing a
complementary filter pair that is used in the active isolation system at the LIGO
\cite{hua05_low_ligo}.
The requirements are very tight (shown by dashed upper bounds
in Fig.~\ref{fig:ligo_weights}) and thus their design is complex.

  The weights are designed such that their inverse magnitude is as
  close as possible to the specifications while being of reasonably \textbf{small order}
  (Fig.~\ref{fig:ligo_weights}).
  After synthesis, the obtained complementary filters are
  compared with the FIR filters \cite{hua05_low_ligo} and are found
  to be very close to each other (Fig.~\ref{fig:comp_fir_ligo_hinf}).
