\textbf{Abstract}
For many applications, large bandwidth and dynamic ranges are requiring to use several sensors, whose signals are combined using complementary filters.
This paper presents a method for designing these complementary filters using $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ synthesis that allows to shape the filter norms.
This method is shown to be easily applicable for the synthesis of complex complementary filters.
